   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to DMRG101 tutorial's pages!
====================================

These pages contain a few exercises to be used with the dmrg101 code. The
exercises are the ones used for the hands-on tutorial of the `Taipei
Density Matrix Renormalization Group Winter School
<http://sites.google.com/site/dmrg101/home>`_. We hope that even those
that could not attend to the School can find this useful to learn some
basics about the `Density Matrix
Renormalization Group algorithm
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_matrix_renormalization_group>`_
(DMRG).

Some of the exercises here are adapted from a similar tutorial by Adrian
Feiguin, published in `Lectures on the Physics of Strongly Correlated
Systems XV <http://scitation.aip.org/proceedings/confproceed/1419.jsp>`_.

This page is only about the tutorial itself. If you need information about
the drmg101 code, check out the `dmrg101 documentation 
<http://dmrg101.readthedocs.org/>`_.

There is also a `PDF version of this webpage
<https://media.readthedocs.org/pdf/dmrg101_tutorial/latest/dmrg101_tutorial.pdf>`_.
